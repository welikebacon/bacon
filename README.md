Installation
-------------------

Run 

  npm install .

to install all dependancies.


MongoDB must be running. If it installed on your computer,
running

  ./rundb.sh

should have it use db as its datadir.

You also need to edit your /etc/hosts as a superuser
and add

  127.0.0.1       baconlocal.host
